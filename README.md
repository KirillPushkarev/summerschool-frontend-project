# Deployed app

    https://issue-tracker-999.herokuapp.com/

# Description

    This is a final project for frontend flow in Xsolla Summerschool 2018.

    This app is a simple Issue tracker.
    You can create, view details, update and delete issues.
    You can view issues in the form of a list and in the form of a board. In the current version, you can not change the order of tasks in the column on board, only drag and drop issues between the columns.

    App is optimized for use on mobile phones. Drag and drop is also working on mobile (just hold issue and drag it).

    CI and CD pipelines are also configured (CircleCI + Heroku).
